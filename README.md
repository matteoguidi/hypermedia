This project is the creation of a hospital website made for the Hypermedia course of Politecnico di Milano.

The remote app is working at the website: https://polimi-hyp-2017-team-10587667.herokuapp.com/

The whole website is not functional, there are some missing pages and errors with the maps provided by Google due to deprecated API. 

All names and places are fictional and not real.
